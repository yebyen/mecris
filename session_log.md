# MCP Server Debugging Session Log - MECRIS

This document summarizes the collaborative debugging session to establish a functional MCP (Machine Context Provider) server for Mecris, integrated with the Gemini CLI. The session involved resolving a series of initialization and tool registration errors within `mcp_server.py`.

## 1. Initial Server Initialization Failure (`NoneType` Error)

**Problem:** The MCP server failed to initialize, reporting a `WARNING:root:Failed to validate request: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'capabilities'`. This indicated an issue with the server's handling of the initial `initialize` JSON-RPC request from the Gemini CLI, specifically concerning the `capabilities` field within the request parameters.

**Initial Attempted Solution:** Based on an assumption about the `mcp-python-sdk`'s internal structure, a custom asynchronous handler (`handle_initialize`) was added to `mcp_server.py` and assigned to `server._initialize_handler`. This handler was designed to return basic server information, expecting the SDK to correctly process the `capabilities`.

## 2. Invalid Request Parameters During Discovery (`-32602` Error)

**Problem:** Despite the custom `initialize` handler, the CLI reported `MCP error -32602: Invalid request parameters` during the discovery phase. Further, it was noted that the server's startup log (`logger.info("Starting Mecris MCP Server in stdio mode...")`) was interfering with the JSON-RPC handshake by printing to `stdout`.

**Solution:**
*   The previous `handle_initialize` function and its assignment were removed, as they were not the correct approach.
*   The `main()` function was updated to leverage `mcp.server.models.InitializationOptions` to explicitly define the server's capabilities for the `server.run()` call.
*   `server.get_capabilities()` was used to retrieve the actual capabilities, which were then passed into `InitializationOptions`.
*   The startup log message was changed from `logger.info` to `logger.error` to ensure it was directed to `sys.stderr`, preventing corruption of the `stdout` JSON-RPC stream.

## 3. Correcting `Server.get_capabilities()` Signature (`TypeError`)

**Problem:** After the previous changes, a `TypeError: Server.get_capabilities() is missing 2 required positional arguments: notification_options and experimental_capabilities` was encountered. This indicated that the `get_capabilities()` method from the `mcp-python-sdk` required specific arguments.

**Solution:**
*   `NotificationOptions` was imported from `mcp.server`.
*   The `server.get_capabilities()` call in `main()` was updated to explicitly pass `notification_options=NotificationOptions()` and `experimental_capabilities={}` as required arguments.

## 4. Resolving Pydantic Validation for `InitializationOptions` (`ValidationError`)

**Problem:** A `pydantic_core._pydantic_core.ValidationError` occurred, stating that the `InitializationOptions` object was missing required fields: `server_name` and `server_version`.

**Solution:**
*   The `InitializationOptions` constructor in `main()` was updated to include `server_name="mecris"` and `server_version="0.2.0"` (or a preferred version) along with the `capabilities`.

## 5. Refactoring to `FastMCP` for Tool Registration ("No prompts, tools, or resources found")

**Problem:** The server was connecting, but the CLI reported: "No prompts, tools, or resources found on the server." This indicated a fundamental issue with how tools were being registered and made available to the MCP client. It was also clarified that the `Server` object being used did not have a `.tool` attribute for decorator-based registration, suggesting an incorrect class choice or usage pattern.

**Solution:**
*   The `mcp_server.py` file was refactored to use `FastMCP` for a simpler and more correct implementation of tool registration.
*   Imports for `Server`, `NotificationOptions`, `stdio_server`, and `InitializationOptions` were replaced with `from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP`.
*   The server initialization was changed from `server = Server("mecris")` to `mcp = FastMCP("mecris")`.
*   All tool functions, which were previously defined in a `server.tools` list and called via a `_call_tool_handler`, were updated to use the `@mcp.tool()` decorator directly above their definitions. This involved removing the `server.tools` list and the `call_tool` function.
*   The `main()` function was entirely removed and replaced with a simplified entry point: `if __name__ == "__main__": mcp.run()`, which automatically handles the stdio server setup.

## 6. Final `FastMCP.tool()` Argument Correction (`TypeError: input_schema`)

**Problem:** After refactoring to `FastMCP`, a `TypeError: FastMCP.tool() got an unexpected keyword argument 'input_schema'` was encountered. This indicated that `FastMCP` automatically infers the tool's input schema from the decorated function's signature and does not accept `input_schema` as a manual argument in the decorator.

**Solution:**
*   The `input_schema` argument was removed from all `@mcp.tool()` decorators across all 14 tool functions.

**Outcome:** With these iterative fixes, the Mecris MCP server should now correctly initialize, register its tools, and communicate effectively with the Gemini CLI.

## 2026-03-26 — mecris-bot goes live, skills loop designed

**Planned**: Get the autonomous bot working end-to-end and test it against a real upstream PR.

...

## 2026-03-31 — Post-Mortem & Fix: Greek Data Corruption (ellinika)

**Planned**: Investigate reports of "spurious" Greek Beeminder data points for the `ellinika` goal; find the source and provide a fix plan.

**Done**: 
- Root cause identified as a category error: treating the `ellinika` odometer/cumulative goal as a backlog-tracking snapshot. 
- **Implemented Fix**: Removed Greek Beeminder push mappings from `scripts/clozemaster_scraper.py` (Python), `services/language_sync_service.py` (Python), and `mecris-go-spin/sync-service/src/lib.rs` (Rust/Failover).
- Updated `tests/test_greek_slug.py` to ensure Greek is no longer automated.
- Published full post-mortem in `docs/postmortems/2026-03-31-greek-data-corruption.md`. 
- Added `GEMINI.md` directive #6 (Goal Type Awareness) to prevent recurrence.

**Next**: Catch up `yebyen/main` with these fixes and redeploy Spin components to Fermyon Cloud.

## 2026-03-31 — Fix Review Pump UX bug: remaining target and unmet goal sorting

**Planned**: Fix Review Pump UX bug where "Target Flow" did not account for completions, and languages were not sorted by urgency. (yebyen/mecris#47)

**Done**:
- Modified `ReviewPump.get_status` (Python) to subtract `daily_completions` from `target_flow_rate` and added `goal_met` boolean.
- Modified `ReviewPump` (Rust/Spin) to mirror the Python logic for consistency across all layers.
- Updated `mcp_server.py` to sort `get_language_velocity_stats` results: unmet goals (`goal_met=False`) are surfaced first, then sorted by remaining `target_flow_rate` descending.
- All 22+ review pump tests (Python) pass.
- Verified fix with dry-run: Greek with 0 debt/liability now shows `target_flow_rate: 0` and `goal_met: True`, ensuring Arabic (untouched) is surfaced first.

**Next**: Permanent fixes for Greek data corruption and Review Pump UX bug are now implemented, committed, pushed to `yebyen/main`, and deployed to Fermyon Cloud.

## 2026-03-31 — Phase 1.5b: componentize-py WASM component for arabic_skip_counter

**Planned**: Set up componentize-py toolchain, write WIT interface for arabic_skip_counter, produce a `.wasm` artifact in `mecris-go-spin/arabic-skip-counter/`. (yebyen/mecris#48)

**Done**:
- Installed `componentize-py 0.21.0` via pip (24MB wheel, works in GitHub Actions runner).
- Created `mecris-go-spin/arabic-skip-counter/wit/world.wit`: exports `count-arabic-reminders(neon-url: string, user-id: string, hours: u32) -> u32`.
- Generated Python bindings via `componentize-py bindings` (produced `wit_world/` stub package).
- Discovered key naming convention: concrete `WitWorld` class in `app.py` must NOT inherit from the generated abstract Protocol — it must be a fresh concrete class with the same name. This resolves the `AssertionError: TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class WitWorld` build error.
- Built `arabic-skip-counter.wasm` (43MB, CPython + httpx embedded) — valid WebAssembly component.
- Added `[component.arabic-skip-counter]` to `spin.toml` with build command and `allowed_outbound_hosts = ["https://*.neon.tech"]`.
- Added `mecris-go-spin/arabic-skip-counter/.gitignore` to exclude WASM artifacts and generated stubs.
- Wrote 6 unit tests in `tests/test_arabic_skip_counter_component.py` — all pass.
- 24/24 total tests pass (no regressions).

**Skipped**: HTTP trigger wrapper (Phase 1.6) — current WIT is a function-export world, not an HTTP component. Deliberate: validates the componentize-py pipeline first; HTTP route is the next increment. `spin call` invocation not tested (spin CLI not installed in runner).

**Next**: Open sync PR to kingdonb/mecris carrying Phase 1.5b. Then Phase 1.6: HTTP wrapper for `/internal/arabic-skip-count` route.

## 2026-03-31 — Phase 1.6: HTTP trigger wrapper for arabic-skip-counter

**Planned**: Add HTTP trigger wrapper for `arabic-skip-counter` — rewrite WIT to WASI HTTP incoming-handler, implement IncomingHandler class, add `neon_db_url` Spin variable, register `GET /internal/arabic-skip-count` route. (yebyen/mecris#50)

**Done**:
- Opened sync PR kingdonb/mecris#161 (yebyen→kingdonb, Phase 1.5b WASM work — pending review).
- Rewrote `world.wit` to WASI HTTP incoming-handler world (wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.0), replacing function-export world.
- Rewrote `app.py`: added `_parse_query_params()`, `_json_response()`, `_error_json()` helper functions; added `IncomingHandler` class using `spin_sdk` (guarded with `try/except ImportError` for CI testability).
- Added `spin-sdk>=3.0.0` to `requirements.txt`.
- Updated `spin.toml`: added `[[trigger.http]]` for `/internal/arabic-skip-count`, added `neon_db_url` to `[variables]`, bound variable in `[component.arabic-skip-counter.variables]`, changed build command to `spin py2wasm app -o arabic-skip-counter.wasm`.
- Replaced 6 `WitWorld` tests with 16 helper-function tests. Total suite: 34/34 passing (up from 24).
- Committed at `6e93e9b`.

**Skipped**: WASM build (`spin py2wasm`) and live HTTP validation (`curl`) — `spin` CLI and `componentize-py` binary not available in CI runner. Also skipped: verify `request.uri` attribute name in spin_sdk>=3.0.0 (may be `request.url`); document componentize-py conventions in `docs/LOGIC_VACUUMING_CANDIDATES.md`.

**Next**: In deployment environment: `pip install -r requirements.txt && spin py2wasm app -o arabic-skip-counter.wasm`, then `curl "http://localhost:3000/internal/arabic-skip-count?user_id=yebyen&hours=24"`. Confirm `{"skip_count": <int>}` response. Open Phase 1.6 sync PR to kingdonb once WASM validates.

## 2026-03-31 — Document componentize-py WitWorld/IncomingHandler conventions

**Planned**: Add "componentize-py Class Naming Conventions" section to `docs/LOGIC_VACUUMING_CANDIDATES.md` covering WitWorld (function-export world) and IncomingHandler (HTTP world) patterns, including try/except ImportError CI guard. (yebyen/mecris#51)

**Done**:
- Added 65-line section to `docs/LOGIC_VACUUMING_CANDIDATES.md` under Candidate 3 covering:
  - Function-export world: fresh concrete `WitWorld` class, no inheritance from generated Protocol.
  - HTTP world: `IncomingHandler(spin_sdk.http.IncomingHandler)`, `try/except ImportError` guard, all logic outside the class for CI testability.
  - `request.uri` attribute note (verify against installed spin-sdk version).
  - Build command reference table for both world types.
  - Rationale: why names are fixed (toolchain binding shim lookup by class name).
- Committed at `53e65b0`. Plan issue yebyen/mecris#51 closed.
- NEXT_SESSION.md updated: componentize-py convention item moved from Pending to Verified.

**Skipped**: WASM build/live test (blocked — no `spin` CLI in CI). Phase 1.6 PR to kingdonb (gated on WASM validation; existing PR #161 carries both 1.5b+1.6 code).

**Next**: WASM build validation in a deployment environment with `spin` + `componentize-py 0.21.0`. Then confirm kingdonb/mecris#161 review/merge path.

## 2026-04-01 — Update PR #161 to reflect Phase 1.5b + 1.6 content

**Planned**: Update kingdonb/mecris#161 title and description to accurately reflect that it carries Phase 1.5b WASM component AND Phase 1.6 HTTP trigger wrapper, since PR was opened before Phase 1.6 commits landed. (yebyen/mecris#52)

**Done**:
- Updated PR #161 title: `feat(phase-1.5b+1.6): arabic_skip_counter WASM component + HTTP trigger wrapper`.
- Rewrote PR body: Phase 1.5b and 1.6 deliverables listed separately, 34/34 test plan checklist, "Next" updated to Phase 1.7 WASM validation.
- Used `gh api --method PATCH` (REST) rather than `gh pr edit` — `gh pr edit` fails with GITHUB_CLASSIC_PAT (repo-only scope) due to `read:org` requirement in GraphQL.
- Noted token scope workaround in NEXT_SESSION.md Infrastructure Notes.

**Skipped**: Nothing — task was tight and complete. WASM build validation still blocked (no `spin` CLI in CI runner).

**Next**: WASM build validation in deployment environment. `spin py2wasm app -o arabic-skip-counter.wasm` in `mecris-go-spin/arabic-skip-counter/`, then live curl test. Await kingdonb/mecris#161 review/merge.

## 🏛️ 2026-04-01 — Health report: orientation only, no unblocked work

**Planned**: Document Phase 1.6/1.7 blocked state and archive cleanly. (yebyen/mecris#53)

**Done**:
- Ran full orient: confirmed yebyen/mecris 7 commits ahead of kingdonb via open PR #161 (awaiting review).
- Confirmed no labeled issues (needs-test/pr-review/bug) in either repo.
- Confirmed no bot-accessible code work unblocked: Phase 1.7 requires live Spin CLI (unavailable in CI), issue #122 is Android UI work, issue #132 needs live Neon/Spin verification.
- Opened health report plan issue yebyen/mecris#53 (closed at archive).
- Updated NEXT_SESSION.md to reflect 2026-04-01 orientation status.

**Skipped**: Code work — nothing unblocked. WASM build still blocked on CI environment. PR #161 still awaiting kingdonb review.

**Next**: WASM build validation in a deployment environment with `spin` + `componentize-py 0.21.0`. `spin py2wasm app -o arabic-skip-counter.wasm` in `mecris-go-spin/arabic-skip-counter/`, then live curl test. Await kingdonb/mecris#161 review/merge.

## 2026-03-31 — Fix: arabic-skip-counter WASM build and Documentation Update

**Planned**: Resolve the `AttributeError: module 'app' has no attribute 'handle_request'` during the `spin py2wasm` build and update project documentation.

**Done**:
- **Fixed `arabic-skip-counter` WASM build**: Added the `handle_request` top-level entry point to `mecris-go-spin/arabic-skip-counter/app.py`, as required by the `spin py2wasm` toolchain.
- **Verified WASM build**: Successfully compiled `arabic-skip-counter.wasm` using the `spin py2wasm` plugin.
- **Updated `GEMINI.md`**: Added a new mandate: **NO RECURSIVE GLOBAL GREP**. This prevents performance issues and unnecessary context usage in large directories.
- **Updated `docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md`**: Added a dedicated section for Playwright installation (`.venv/bin/python3 -m playwright install`) to resolve "missing browser binaries" errors during automated scrapers.
- **Documented Groq Scraping Decision**: Added a reference to the [Groq community thread](https://community.groq.com/t/add-api-endpoint-to-fetch-billing-and-usage-data/378) in `fetch_groq_usage.py` and `claude_api_budget_scraper.py` to explain the intentional avoidance of scraping Groq due to Google SSO and the lack of an official API.
- **Verified `trigger_language_sync`**: Confirmed that the Clozemaster-to-Beeminder sync is fully functional after the Playwright installation.
- **Merged `yebyen/main`**: Pulled and reviewed the latest changes from the autonomous worker, resolving the WASM build blocker.

**Next**: Push all changes to `origin/main` and confirm the deployment status in Fermyon Cloud.

## 🏛️ 2026-04-01 — Test coverage audit for kingdonb review-pump + language-velocity fixes

**Planned**: Audit test coverage for 5 commits kingdonb pushed today (dc2e1fe→f62ad68): review-pump goal_met refinement, GREEK canonical goal, language-velocity safebuf/beeminder_slug columns. Add targeted pytest cases. (yebyen/mecris#55)

**Done**:
- Read all 5 kingdonb commits and identified 3 coverage gaps.
- Added `test_goal_met_when_debt_rounds_to_zero_target_with_aggressive_multiplier` — covers fix 5cb1397: small debt with multiplier > 1.0 rounds target to 0, goal_met=True.
- Added `test_goal_met_false_in_maintenance_mode_with_outstanding_debt` — regression guard for maintenance-mode debt path.
- Added `test_get_language_stats_includes_beeminder_slug_and_safebuf` — covers fix f62ad68: 8-column DB query returns new fields.
- Fixed pre-existing wrong assertion in `test_system_overdrive` (target_flow_rate is remaining work, not total target).
- Committed as ec4d578. 13/13 pass in the two touched test files.

**Skipped**: GREEK canonical test — Rust sync-service (9d90f69) cannot be unit-tested from Python. No open issues remain on either repo. Phase 1.7 WASM build still blocked on CI environment.

**Next**: WASM build validation in a deployment environment with `spin` + `componentize-py 0.21.0`. `spin py2wasm app -o arabic-skip-counter.wasm` in `mecris-go-spin/arabic-skip-counter/`, then live curl test.

## 🏛️ 2026-04-01 — Session 2: Propose test coverage upstream via kingdonb/mecris#163

**Planned**: Open health report, propose the 2 ahead commits (test coverage for goal_met edge cases + beeminder_slug/safebuf) as a PR to kingdonb/mecris if clean, then archive. (yebyen/mecris#56)

**Done**:
- Ran full orient: yebyen/mecris 2 commits ahead of kingdonb (ec4d578 test coverage + cf4af18 archive). Zero open issues on both repos. All WASM tasks blocked on live environment.
- Confirmed ec4d578 is clean for upstream: only `tests/test_neon_sync_checker.py` and `tests/test_review_pump.py` — no yebyen-private content.
- Created branch `test/review-pump-neon-coverage-2026-04-01` in yebyen/mecris at ec4d578 and pushed.
- Opened PR kingdonb/mecris#163 with test coverage for goal_met edge cases + beeminder_slug/safebuf columns.

**Skipped**: Nothing unblocked was skipped. WASM build validation still requires live Spin CLI unavailable in CI. Issue #122 (Android) and Issue #132 (live Spin/Neon) remain out of scope for bot.

**Next**: Check if kingdonb/mecris#163 has been reviewed/merged. If merged, confirm yebyen/mecris sync state. WASM build validation in a deployment environment with `spin` + `componentize-py 0.21.0`.

## 🏛️ 2026-04-01 — Session 3: pr-test fork-PR bug diagnosis (partial)

**Planned**: Dispatch pr-test against kingdonb/mecris#163 and post results as a comment. (yebyen/mecris#57)

**Done**:
- Ran full orient: PR #163 still open, no labels, no CI run, no upstream activity since session 2.
- Dispatched pr-test twice (runs #23863414611 and #23863517252). Both failed at "Fetch and merge upstream PR branch" step.
- Root cause confirmed: `pr-test.yml` always tries `git merge upstream/${PR_BRANCH}`. PR #163 head is on yebyen/mecris (fork), so the branch doesn't exist in `upstream` (kingdonb/mecris) — it's in `origin`.
- Fix identified: detect `head.repo.full_name` from PR API; use `git fetch origin ${PR_BRANCH}` if head is yebyen. The checkout's `fetch-depth: 0` already fetches all origin branches, so it's available.
- Committed fix locally as 412f032 but could not push: both PATs lack `workflow` scope required by GitHub to modify `.github/workflows/` files. Reverted 412f032 to avoid breaking the mecris-bot.yml push step.
- Posted blocker comment on kingdonb/mecris#163 explaining the token scope issue.

**Skipped**: Deploying the pr-test fix — blocked on `workflow` scope in MECRIS_BOT_CLASSIC_PAT. PR #163 cannot be auto-tested until kingdonb updates the secret.

**Next**: Ask kingdonb to update MECRIS_BOT_CLASSIC_PAT to include `repo + workflow` scopes. Once done, re-run `/mecris-pr-test 163` which will pick up the fix in NEXT_SESSION.md.

## 🏛️ 2026-04-01 — Session 4: Nag Ladder Tier field + Tier 3 WhatsApp High Urgency detection (complete)

**Planned**: Add explicit `tier` (1/2/3) to all `check_reminder_needed()` return dicts, add Tier 3 detection for goals with runway < 2 hours, update `nag eval` CLI output. (yebyen/mecris#58)

**Done**:
- Orient: PR #163 still open, no `needs-test`/`pr-review` labels, pr-test fix still blocked on workflow-scope token. Identified kingdonb/mecris#139 (Nag Ladder) as highest-value tractable work.
- Opened plan yebyen/mecris#58 before touching code.
- Added `_parse_runway_hours()` to `ReminderService`: parses "N hours" format only; "N days" returns 999 to avoid false Tier 3 triggers.
- Added Tier 3 check at top of `check_reminder_needed()`: CRITICAL goals with `runway < 2.0 hours` → `beeminder_emergency_tier3` at `tier: 3`, 1h cooldown.
- Added `tier: 1` to `walk_reminder`, `arabic_review_reminder`, `beeminder_emergency`.
- Added `tier: 2` to `arabic_review_escalation`, `momentum_coaching`.
- Updated `nag eval` CLI to show "Tier: N" alongside send/no-send status.
- Added 4 new tests: tier 1 on walk_reminder, tier 2 on escalation, tier 3 on "1.5 hours" runway, no tier 3 for "0 days".
- 17/17 reminder_service tests pass; 29/29 target tests pass. Committed c4857ba.

**Skipped**: Tier 2 generalization (freeform Claude for any goal type after idle window) — needs acknowledgement tracking design first. Documented in NEXT_SESSION.md Pending.

**Next**: Check if kingdonb/mecris#163 has been reviewed/merged. If MECRIS_BOT_CLASSIC_PAT workflow scope is granted, deploy pr-test fix and re-run /mecris-pr-test 163. Otherwise: design Tier 2 acknowledgement tracking as a sub-issue of #139.

## 🏛️ 2026-04-01 — Session 5: Nag Ladder Tier 2 time-based escalation (complete)

**Planned**: Add Tier 2 time-based escalation to `ReminderService` — any Tier 1 result escalates to Tier 2 (`use_template: False`) after `TIER2_IDLE_HOURS` idle, using `message_log` history via `log_provider`. (yebyen/mecris#59)

**Done**:
- Orient: PR #163 still open, no upstream activity, pr-test fix still token-blocked. Identified Tier 2 generalization as highest-value unblocked work.
- Opened plan yebyen/mecris#59 with full design notes before touching code.
- Added `TIER2_IDLE_HOURS = 6.0` module constant to `services/reminder_service.py`.
- Added `_apply_tier2_escalation()` async helper: skips Tier 2/3 results, uses existing `_get_hours_since_last()` (999.0 sentinel for no history/no provider → safe no-op).
- Applied escalation at all 3 Tier 1 return sites: walk_reminder, beeminder_emergency, arabic_review_reminder.
- Added 5 new tests covering: escalation fires after 6h (beeminder + walk), stays Tier 1 under 6h, no escalation without log_provider, Tier 3 unaffected.
- 22/22 reminder_service tests pass. Committed 3a34478.

**Skipped**: Acknowledgement tracking / explicit reset mechanism for escalation state — implicit reset (goal exits CRITICAL → condition never fires) may be sufficient. Needs design decision before next coding slice.

**Next**: Decide if implicit reset is sufficient for Tier 2 ack tracking (document decision as sub-issue of kingdonb/mecris#139). Then either: deploy pr-test fix if MECRIS_BOT_CLASSIC_PAT workflow scope is granted, or continue with Tier 2 ack tracking design.

## 🏛️ 2026-04-01 — Session 6: Removal of undeliverable SMS path (complete)

**Planned**: Remove all SMS fallback logic and Tier 3 SMS emergency path due to missing A2P 10DLC registration. Redefine Tier 3 as WhatsApp High Urgency.

**Done**:
- Disabled `send_sms` in `twilio_sender.py` with an error log explaining the A2P blocker.
- Removed SMS fallback from `smart_send_message` in `twilio_sender.py`.
- Renamed `sms_emergency` to `beeminder_emergency_tier3` in `ReminderService`.
- Updated Tier 3 logic to use freeform WhatsApp messages for high-urgency alerts (< 2h runway).
- Updated all unit tests in `tests/test_reminder_service.py` to reflect the new WhatsApp-only reality for Tier 3.
- Verified all 22 `reminder_service` tests pass.
- Updated `NEXT_SESSION.md` and `session_log.md` to remove SMS references.

**Skipped**: None.

**Next**: Merge `review-bot-changes` to `main` and deploy.

## 🏛️ 2026-04-01 — Session 7: Tier 2 escalation reset semantics — implicit reset proven (complete)

**Planned**: Determine whether Tier 2 escalation resets correctly via implicit means or requires explicit `last_acknowledged` tracking; document with a test; implement only if gap found. (yebyen/mecris#61)

**Done**:
- Orient: discovered PR #163 is MERGED (was listed as open in session 5 notes). Repos now fully in sync at b28285e. Zero open issues on either repo.
- Opened plan yebyen/mecris#61 before touching code.
- Read `reminder_service.py` fully; traced escalation reset for beeminder_emergency, walk_reminder, and arabic_review_reminder paths.
- Design decision: **implicit reset is sufficient** — two mechanisms: (1) condition exit (goal not CRITICAL, walk done) skips code path entirely; (2) Tier 2 send logs same type, resetting hours_since_last, so next fire (4h later) sees 4h < TIER2_IDLE_HOURS=6h → Tier 1.
- Posted full analysis to yebyen/mecris#61 as a comment before coding.
- Added `test_tier2_escalation_resets_after_tier2_message_sent`: proves beeminder Tier 2 resets after send.
- Added `test_tier2_walk_escalation_implicit_reset_when_user_walks`: proves walk Tier 2 cannot stick after activity.
- 25/25 reminder_service tests pass. Committed 354cae4.

**Skipped**: No explicit `last_acknowledged` implementation — analysis showed it is not needed. Tier 2 message content (what does a Tier 2 walk_reminder actually say?) is deferred.

**Next**: If MECRIS_BOT_CLASSIC_PAT workflow scope is granted, deploy pr-test fork-PR fix. Otherwise: Tier 2 freeform message content design (what coaching text does the escalated walk_reminder send?).

## 🏛️ 2026-04-02 — Session 9: Ghost Presence Detection — ghost.presence module (complete)

**Planned**: Implement `presence.lock`-based coordination for autonomous ghost sessions so they can signal aliveness and yield to human operators. (yebyen/mecris#62)

**Done**:
- Orient: NEXT_SESSION.md identified Goal 1 Phase 1 (Ghost Presence Detection) as highest priority. No issues tagged needs-test/pr-review/bug on either repo. yebyen in sync with kingdonb.
- Opened plan yebyen/mecris#62 before touching code.
- Discovered `cli/main.py::run_presence()` already had inline presence logic (check/take/release) but no importable module and no tests.
- Created `ghost/__init__.py` and `ghost/presence.py` with: `acquire_lock()`, `release_lock()`, `check_presence()`, `presence_lock()` context manager, `PresenceStatus` dataclass, configurable TTL (default 30 min).
- Created `tests/test_ghost_presence.py` with 16 tests: acquire creates file, writes timestamp, release removes file, returns True/False correctly, roundtrip, no-lock means no human, fresh lock means human present, stale lock means human gone, custom TTL, lock path in status, context manager creates/removes/yields path/releases on exception/detects concurrent session.
- Refactored `cli/main.py::run_presence()` to import from `ghost.presence` — no behavior change, logic centralized.
- All 16 tests pass. Committed 3f06f2b.

**Skipped**: Archivist ghost session wiring (Phase 2) — out of scope for this plan issue. Carried forward.

**Next**: Create `ghost/archivist.py` — cron-invocable script that checks presence, calls a pulse MCP function, and logs to `logs/ghost_archivist.log`.

## 🏛️ 2026-04-02 — Session 10: Ghost Archivist — ghost.archivist module (complete)

**Planned**: Create `ghost/archivist.py` — cron-invocable presence-aware pulse logger. (yebyen/mecris#63)

**Done**:
- Orient: NEXT_SESSION.md identified Ghost Archivist (Goal 1 Phase 2) as highest priority. No issues tagged needs-test/pr-review/bug on either repo. yebyen is 2 commits ahead of kingdonb.
- Opened plan yebyen/mecris#63 before touching code.
- Read `ghost/presence.py` and `mcp_server.py` to understand available interfaces; confirmed `/health` and `/narrator/context` HTTP endpoints exist on FastAPI at localhost:8000.
- Created `ghost/archivist.py` with: `run()` (main entrypoint), `pulse()` (HTTP health probe with offline fallback), `_write_log()` (ISO-8601 UTC append). Env var overrides for lock path, log path, and MCP URL.
- Created `tests/test_archivist.py` with 10 tests: pulse online/offline/timeout, YIELD path, PULSE online path, PULSE offline path, log dir creation, return codes, ISO timestamp.
- All 10 tests pass. Committed e8ef739.
- Smoke test verified: `python ghost/archivist.py` logs `[PULSE] mcp=offline` correctly when server is not running.

**Skipped**: Cron/scheduler registration (Phase 3) — out of scope for this plan issue. Carried forward.

**Next**: Wire `ghost/archivist.py` into `scheduler.py` as a recurring cron job; verify `logs/ghost_archivist.log` accumulates entries autonomously.

## 🏛️ 2026-04-02 — Session 11: Ghost Archivist — cron scheduler integration (complete)

**Planned**: Register `ghost/archivist.run()` as a 15-minute interval leader job in `scheduler.py`. (yebyen/mecris#64)

**Done**:
- Orient: NEXT_SESSION.md identified Goal 1 Phase 3 (Cron Integration) as highest priority. No issues tagged needs-test/pr-review/bug on either repo.
- Opened plan yebyen/mecris#64 before touching code.
- Read `scheduler.py` in full to understand the leader-job pattern (`_start_leader_jobs` / `_stop_leader_jobs`).
- Added `_global_archivist_job(user_id)` to `scheduler.py`: checks `is_leader`, imports and calls `ghost.archivist.run()`, catches all exceptions and logs errors.
- Registered in `_start_leader_jobs` with `minutes=15`, `id=auto_archivist_{user_id}`; registered removal in `_stop_leader_jobs`.
- Added `TestGlobalArchivistJob` to `tests/test_archivist.py` with 3 tests: leader fires run(), non-leader skips, exceptions are caught and logged. Used autouse fixture to mock psycopg2/apscheduler at import time.
- Updated `tests/test_scheduler_election.py` leader job counts from 4→5 (adds/removes).
- All 13 archivist tests pass; all 16 presence tests pass. Committed 205aed4.

**Skipped**: Nothing — Goal 1 Phase 3 is complete.

**Next**: Nag Ladder Tier 2 message content (kingdonb/mecris#139) — decide on coaching copy for escalated walk/Beeminder alerts.

## 🏛️ 2026-04-02 — Session 12: Nag Ladder Tier 2 — escalated coaching copy (complete)

**Planned**: Implement actual Tier 2 coaching copy in `services/reminder_service.py` to replace generic `fallback_message`. (yebyen/mecris#65)

**Done**:
- Orient: NEXT_SESSION.md flagged Nag Ladder Tier 2 as HIGHEST PRIORITY. Confirmed kingdonb/mecris#163 (PR-Test Fix) is now MERGED — blocker resolved.
- Opened plan yebyen/mecris#65; posted analysis comment confirming root cause before coding.
- Read `services/reminder_service.py` and `tests/test_reminder_service.py` in full. Root cause: `_apply_tier2_escalation` sets `tier=2` and `use_template=False` but leaves `fallback_message` as the Tier 1 coaching copy.
- Red: added 3 failing tests — walk_reminder Tier 2 content, beeminder_emergency Tier 2 content, generic type fallback.
- Green: added `_build_tier2_message()` to `ReminderService`; wired into `_apply_tier2_escalation`. Walk path references Boris & Fiona + hours idle; beeminder path names specific goal title + hours idle; generic path is appropriately urgent.
- All 28 tests pass (25 existing + 3 new). Committed 0898f44.

**Skipped**: Arabic review reminder Tier 2 path — the `arabic_review_reminder` goes through `_apply_tier2_escalation` but gets the generic fallback (no `variables` dict). Scope decision deferred to next session.

**Next**: Decide whether `arabic_review_reminder` Tier 2 needs its own `_build_tier2_message` branch (references Arabic goal context); add test if so.

## 🏛️ 2026-04-02 — Session 13: Nag Ladder — Arabic review reminder Tier 2 contextual copy (complete)

**Planned**: Add `arabic_review_reminder` branch in `_build_tier2_message()` with test coverage for idle-based Tier 2 promotion. (yebyen/mecris#66)

**Done**:
- Orient: NEXT_SESSION.md flagged Arabic review reminder Tier 2 path as next pending item. Repos in sync.
- Opened plan yebyen/mecris#66; posted analysis discovering that `arabic_review_reminder` does have `variables` dict — NEXT_SESSION.md note was inaccurate.
- Added `if msg_type == "arabic_review_reminder":` branch to `_build_tier2_message()`: returns "Arabic reviews still overdue after Nh. reviewstack won't fix itself — open Clozemaster NOW."
- Added `test_arabic_review_reminder_tier2_fallback_is_contextual`: reviewstack CRITICAL + arabic_review_reminder sent 7h ago → tier=2, use_template=False, fallback references Arabic context.
- All 29 tests pass. Committed 2b18381.

**Skipped**: Nothing — plan complete.

**Next**: Ghost archivist live validation (requires live environment); upstream PR to kingdonb/mecris for sessions 9-13.

## 🏛️ 2026-04-02 — Session 14: Nag Ladder Tier 3 test coverage (complete)

**Planned**: Implement Nag Ladder Tier 3 — High Urgency path for <2h Beeminder runway. (yebyen/mecris#67)

**Done**:
- Orient: Recommended implementing Tier 3 (kingdonb/mecris#139 still open). Discovered on inspection that Tier 3 was already implemented (services/reminder_service.py:123-139) with 3 existing tests. Plan issue updated with discovery.
- Identified genuine test gaps: Tier 3 cooldown path, 2.0h exact boundary (strictly < 2.0), and missing _parse_runway_hours unit tests.
- Added 3 new tests: `test_tier3_on_cooldown_returns_should_send_false`, `test_tier3_not_triggered_for_exactly_2h_runway`, `test_parse_runway_hours_returns_hours_for_hours_unit` (covers 5 cases).
- 32/32 tests pass (was 29). Committed bcd9469.
- Attempted to comment on kingdonb/mecris#139 — blocked (GITHUB_TOKEN scope is yebyen-only). Noted for human follow-up.

**Skipped**: CLI `bin/mecris nag eval` tier output verification (requires live environment). Cross-repo comment on #139 (token scope issue).

**Next**: Upstream PR to kingdonb/mecris for sessions 9-14 work (close #139); then tackle kingdonb/mecris#164 (ghost presence global Neon).

## 🏛️ 2026-04-02 — Session 15: Upstream PR — Nag Ladder complete (sessions 9-14) → kingdonb/mecris#165

**Planned**: Open upstream PR from yebyen/mecris main to kingdonb/mecris main closing Nag Ladder issue #139. (yebyen/mecris#68)

**Done**:
- Orient: yebyen/mecris 4 commits ahead of kingdonb/mecris (HEAD f823cb6); no open PRs; #139 still open.
- Opened plan yebyen/mecris#68 with spec: open upstream PR referencing #139, 32 tests confirmed.
- Created kingdonb/mecris#165 via GITHUB_CLASSIC_PAT (fine-grained token lacks cross-repo PR scope).
- Commented on kingdonb/mecris#139 via GITHUB_CLASSIC_PAT — confirmed working (was blocked in session 14).
- PR description includes all three tier table, 32/32 test count, and Closes #139.

**Skipped**: Nothing — plan complete. PR merge requires human (or bot with kingdonb/mecris write access).

**Next**: kingdonb/mecris#164 (Ghost Presence Global Neon Evolution) — start in yebyen fork while #165 awaits merge.

## 2026-04-02 — Ghost Presence Phase 1: Neon table, state machine, tests (session 16)

**Planned**: Add SQL migration for `presence` table, refactor `ghost/presence.py` with Neon-backed store + POUND_SAND/SOFY state machine, write 17-test unit suite. Keep `mcp_server.py` changes to Phase 2. (yebyen/mecris#69)

**Done**: All three deliverables complete. `scripts/migrations/001_presence_table.sql` created with `presence_status_type` enum (5 values). `ghost/presence.py` extended with `StatusType`, `PresenceRecord`, `NeonPresenceStore` (upsert, get, set_pound_sand, escalate_to_sofy), and `get_neon_store()` fallback — file-based lock API 100% unchanged. 17/17 new tests pass (`tests/test_presence_neon.py`); 29/29 existing ghost tests unaffected. Plan issue yebyen/mecris#69 closed.

**Skipped**: `mcp_server.py` middleware integration (Phase 2) and `get_narrator_context` SOFY surfacing — explicitly deferred. SQL migration not yet applied to live Neon DB (requires human or live-env session).

**Next**: kingdonb/mecris#164 Phase 2 — `mcp_server.py` middleware records ACTIVE_HUMAN on every tool call; `get_narrator_context` surfaces SOFY status. Apply `scripts/migrations/001_presence_table.sql` to live Neon DB first.

## 2026-04-03 — Ghost Presence Phase 2: mcp_server middleware + SOFY surfacing (session 17)

**Planned**: Add `_record_presence()` middleware to `mcp_server.py` upsert ACTIVE_HUMAN on every tool invocation; surface current `status_type` (especially SOFY) in `get_narrator_context` response; write unit tests with mocked `NeonPresenceStore`. (yebyen/mecris#70)

**Done**: All deliverables complete. Added `_record_presence()` (upserts ACTIVE_HUMAN, swallows errors, no-op when Neon unavailable) and `_get_presence_status()` (returns status_type string or None). `get_narrator_context` now calls `_record_presence` before building response and includes `presence_status` in the returned dict. 4/4 new tests pass in `tests/test_mcp_server.py` following the established `test_reminder_integration.py` mocking pattern. 0 regressions (218 passing, 5 pre-existing failures untouched).

**Skipped**: Upstream PR for kingdonb/mecris#164 — Phase 1 + Phase 2 together need a bundled PR. Deferred to next session. SQL migration to live Neon DB (human action required).

**Next**: Open upstream PR to kingdonb/mecris for Ghost Presence Phases 1+2 (referencing kingdonb/mecris#164). Use GITHUB_CLASSIC_PAT.

## 2026-04-03 — Update PR #165 body to cover Ghost Presence + fix closes links (session 18)

**Planned**: Update kingdonb/mecris#165 PR body to document Ghost Presence Phases 1+2 (sessions 16–17) alongside Nag Ladder, and add `Closes kingdonb/mecris#164` so the presence issue closes on merge. (yebyen/mecris#72)

**Done**: PR #165 title updated to "feat: Complete Nag Ladder + Ghost Presence (Neon-backed coordination) — sessions 13-17". Body rewritten to cover all five sessions (13–17) with Ghost Presence state machine diagram, Phase 1 (Neon table + state machine) and Phase 2 (mcp_server middleware) detail, pending live-validation notes, and full test plan. `Closes kingdonb/mecris#139` and `Closes kingdonb/mecris#164` both confirmed present in body. Used GITHUB_CLASSIC_PAT for cross-repo PATCH via GitHub API.

**Skipped**: Nothing — task was narrow and fully executed.

**Next**: kingdonb/mecris#165 awaits human review + merge. After merge: sync yebyen fork from upstream and apply `scripts/migrations/001_presence_table.sql` to live Neon DB.

## 2026-04-03 — get_system_health MCP tool + fix pre-existing test failure (session 19) 🏛️

**Planned**: Implement `get_system_health` MCP tool backed by `scheduler_election` table (kingdonb/mecris#97); fix pre-existing `test_language_sync_service_coordination` failure. (yebyen/mecris#74)

**Done**: `services/health_checker.py` created — `HealthChecker.get_system_health()` reads `scheduler_election`, returns per-process `is_active` + ISO heartbeat string, and sets `overall_status` to "healthy"/"degraded". `mcp_server.py` tool delegates to `HealthChecker` and appends live scheduler leader metadata. 6 new unit tests in `tests/test_system_health.py` pass (all_active, stale, no_neon_url, db_error, heartbeat_serialized, mixed_active). `test_language_sync_service_coordination` fixed: added `mock_beeminder.user_id = None` + replaced fragile `call_count == 4` assertion with SQL content checks. 214 passing, 0 regressions.

**Skipped**: Nothing from the plan was skipped.

**Next**: kingdonb/mecris#165 still awaits human review + merge. Session 19 additions (health_checker, get_system_health, test_system_health) are on yebyen/mecris main but not yet in a PR to kingdonb/mecris — next session should either fold into #165 or open a new PR post-merge.

## 2026-04-03 — Idempotent Beeminder pushes via requestid + PR #165 body update (session 20) 🏛️

**Planned**: Add deterministic `requestid` to `add_datapoint` calls in `clozemaster_scraper.py` so Beeminder upserts on retry (kingdonb/mecris#124); update PR #165 body to document session 19 `get_system_health` + `Closes kingdonb/mecris#97`. (yebyen/mecris#75)

**Done**: Both deliverables complete. PR #165 body updated via REST API (GITHUB_CLASSIC_PAT) — now covers all six sessions and closes #97. `clozemaster_scraper.py` refactored: removed `get_goal_datapoints` prefetch loop, added `requestid = f"{goal_slug}-{today_eastern.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}"` passed to `add_datapoint`. Beeminder deduplicates server-side via requestid — no race condition, no extra API call. `test_clozemaster_idempotency.py` rewritten with 5 focused tests asserting requestid format, absence of prefetch, dry-run skip, and unknown-goal skip. 217 passing, 0 regressions.

**Skipped**: Nothing from the plan was skipped.

**Next**: Open a new PR to kingdonb/mecris for session 20 work (`Closes kingdonb/mecris#124`) — either bundle into #165 before merge or open separately post-merge. kingdonb/mecris#165 still awaits human review.

## 2026-04-03 — session 21: PR #165 body updated through session 20

🏛️

**Planned**: Update kingdonb/mecris#165 body to add session 20 section (idempotent Beeminder `requestid`) and append `Closes kingdonb/mecris#124` to closing keywords (yebyen/mecris#77).

**Done**: PR #165 title updated to "sessions 13-20"; body now includes a dedicated "Session 20 — Idempotent Beeminder Pushes" section describing `scripts/clozemaster_scraper.py` and `tests/test_clozemaster_idempotency.py`; closing keywords include all four upstream issues (#139, #164, #97, #124); test plan updated with 5/5 idempotency tests and 217 total passing.

**Skipped**: Nothing — scope was small and bounded.

**Next**: PR #165 still awaiting kingdonb review + merge. After merge: sync yebyen/mecris from upstream, then evaluate kingdonb/mecris#162 (OIDC Submarine Mode) or #130 (Clozemaster activity tracking) as next feature work.

## 2026-04-03 — Fix score-delta backup detection in LanguageSyncService (session 22) 🏛️

**Planned**: Replace no-op `pass` in `_update_neon_db()` backup activity detection with real delta logic; add test asserting delta=100 when last_points=500→points=600 with no upstream "today" data (yebyen/mecris#79).

**Done**: Fixed `services/language_sync_service.py` lines 73–79: removed structural no-op, implemented `if activity_metric == 0 and diff > daily_completions: daily_completions = diff` with info log. Added `test_score_delta_backup_detection_updates_daily_completions` to `tests/test_language_sync_service.py` — test passes. 218 total passing (was 217), 0 regressions. Addresses kingdonb/mecris#130 (score-delta path now functional). Commit `d7945e3`.

**Skipped**: Nothing — scope was small and fully delivered.

**Next**: PR #165 still awaiting kingdonb review + merge. After merge: sync upstream, open new PR for session 22 fix (`d7945e3`) targeting kingdonb/mecris#130, then evaluate #162 (OIDC Submarine Mode) or #129 (Greek backlog booster).

## 2026-04-03 — OIDC submarine mode root cause analysis (session 23) 🏛️

**Planned**: Analyze `PocketIdAuth.kt` for submarine-mode token refresh failures, post technical report to kingdonb/mecris#162, update `docs/AUTH_CONFIGURATION.md` (yebyen/mecris#81).

**Done**: Read `PocketIdAuth.kt` and `MainActivity.kt` in full. Identified four compounding bugs: (1) missing `offline_access` scope at line 67 — no durable refresh token issued; (2) network errors treated as permanent auth failures at lines 109–112 — `AuthState.Error` broadcast on `SocketTimeoutException`; (3) Error state triggers "Sign In" UI which abandons valid Refresh Token (`MainActivity.kt:1063–1074`); (4) no proactive token refresh in `WalkHeuristicsWorker`. Technical report posted to kingdonb/mecris#162 (comment #4185361982). `docs/AUTH_CONFIGURATION.md` updated with "Root Cause Analysis" section. Commit `e9cc1c0`.

**Skipped**: Implementation of the fixes — analysis only was scoped. Android build/PR would need a dedicated session.

**Next**: PR #165 still awaiting kingdonb review + merge. After merge: sync upstream, open PR for session 22 score-delta fix, then implement the OIDC fixes (4 items in NEXT_SESSION.md) as next Android engineering session.

## 2026-04-03 — OIDC submarine mode fix implementation (session 24) 🏛️

**Planned**: Implement 4 Android-side OIDC fixes in PocketIdAuth.kt, MainActivity.kt, WalkHeuristicsWorker; dispatch pr-test to confirm Android build (yebyen/mecris#82).

**Done**: All 4 fixes implemented and committed (`1151698`). (1) Added `"offline_access"` to scopes in `PocketIdAuth.kt:67`. (2) Distinguished transient network errors from permanent OAuth failures in `getValidAccessToken` — only `TYPE_OAUTH_TOKEN_ERROR` broadcasts `AuthState.Error`. (3) Added `isPermanent: Boolean = true` to `AuthState.Error`; split Idle/Error branches in `MainActivity.kt:1063–1074` so Sign In button only appears for permanent failures. (4) Updated WalkHeuristicsWorker comment confirming `getAccessTokenSuspend()` at top of `doWork()` is the proactive refresh. `docs/AUTH_CONFIGURATION.md` updated to mark all 4 bugs ✅ Fixed. pr-test run 23966570693 ✅ success.

**Skipped**: Nothing — all planned work delivered.

**Next**: PR #165 still awaiting kingdonb review + merge. PR body needs updating to describe sessions 22–24. After merge: sync upstream; kingdonb/mecris#162 and #130 can be closed as partially addressed by merged work.

## 2026-04-04 — Test coverage for sleep window exceptions + fuzzed dynamic cooldown (session 25) 🏛️

**Planned**: Write pytest coverage for sleep window exceptions and fuzzed dynamic cooldown logic added in d58771f, then close stale issues kingdonb/mecris#162 and #130 (yebyen/mecris#83).

**Done**: 5 new tests added to `tests/test_reminder_service.py`: (1) `test_calculate_dynamic_cooldown_floor_at_45_minutes` — verifies floor never < 0.75h over 50 random runs. (2) `test_calculate_dynamic_cooldown_shorter_in_evening` — confirms 0.6h reduction at hour=20 with fuzz patched to 0. (3) `test_tier3_fires_at_3am_during_emergency_sleep` — Tier 3 exempt from all sleep windows. (4) `test_beeminder_emergency_fires_at_10pm_normal_sleep_not_emergency` — non-Tier-3 beeminder fires at 22:00 since it's not emergency sleep. (5) `test_beeminder_emergency_suppressed_at_3am_by_emergency_sleep` — non-Tier-3 blocked at 3am. Fixed pre-existing `test_tier2_escalation_resets_after_tier2_message_sent` (4.0h → 4.5h threshold broken by fuzz). 233 passing, 0 new regressions. Comments posted on kingdonb/mecris#162 and #130.

**Skipped**: Cannot directly close kingdonb/mecris issues (write access not granted to yebyen PAT). PR body update for sessions 22–24 deferred (PR already merged, lower priority).

**Next**: Decide on next feature from open epics: #170 (Majesty Cake widget), #166 (Multi-user Twilio), #169 (Rust reminder engine), or smaller scope items #129/#127.

## 2026-04-04 — Majesty Cake backend: get_daily_aggregate_status MCP tool (session 26) 🏛️

**Planned**: Implement `get_daily_aggregate_status` MCP tool returning daily goal completion count (X/Y) and all_clear flag for walk, Arabic review pump, and Greek review pump (yebyen/mecris#84).

**Done**: Tool implemented at `mcp_server.py:836` using `@mcp.tool`. Composes existing `get_cached_daily_activity("bike")` for walk goal and `get_language_velocity_stats()` for Arabic/Greek `goal_met`. Returns `{goals, satisfied_count, total_count, all_clear, score}`. Exception-resilient: each goal independently handled — failure in one goal does not prevent others from being evaluated. 7 new tests in `tests/test_daily_aggregate_status.py` covering all satisfaction states, partial completion, missing language data, and walk exception handling. Committed `6543fa6`. 239 tests passing (240 total, 3 pre-existing failures — no regressions).

**Skipped**: Phase 2 Android integration — wiring Android app to call the new endpoint. Too large for this session; carry forward to next.

**Next**: kingdonb/mecris#170 Phase 2 — either (a) surface `get_daily_aggregate_status` in `get_narrator_context` recommendations array for immediate LLM utility, or (b) plan Android app widget integration. Option (a) is smaller scope and immediately testable.

## 2026-04-04 — Majesty Cake Phase 2: surface aggregate status in get_narrator_context (session 27) 🏛️

**Planned**: Add a call to `get_daily_aggregate_status` inside `get_narrator_context` so the aggregate goal score (X/Y) and `all_clear` flag are surfaced without a separate MCP tool call (yebyen/mecris#86).

**Done**: Added 14 lines to `get_narrator_context` (mcp_server.py:299–309): calls `get_daily_aggregate_status(user_id)`, appends a 🎂 Majesty Cake recommendation on all_clear or 🎯 progress recommendation otherwise, adds `daily_aggregate_status` key to the return dict. Exception-wrapped so narrator context never crashes due to aggregate failure. 4 new tests in `tests/test_narrator_aggregate_integration.py` cover: key presence, partial-score recommendation, all_clear celebration, error resilience. 245 tests passing (was 239), 1 pre-existing failure unchanged. Committed `6de9d2b`.

**Skipped**: Android widget integration (Phase 3) — requires Kotlin/Android build environment; carry forward.

**Next**: kingdonb/mecris#170 Phase 3 — Android widget: wire `HomeFragment` to call `get_daily_aggregate_status`, display X/Y counter, show Majesty Cake animation on all_clear.

## 2026-04-04 — Majesty Cake Phase 3: promote aggregate recommendation in narrator context

🏛️ **Planned**: Move `daily_aggregate_status` recommendation from last position to early in `get_narrator_context` recommendations list; add ordering test confirming it appears before informational items (yebyen/mecris#87).

**Done**: Restructured the recommendations block in `mcp_server.py`. Majesty Cake try/except moved to run immediately after critical Beeminder/budget checks (position 3 in list). When `all_clear=True`, uses `insert(0, ...)` so the celebration leads the entire list. When partial, appended after critical items but before walk/anthropic/groq recommendations. Added 2 new ordering tests: `test_narrator_all_clear_cake_is_first_recommendation` and `test_narrator_partial_progress_precedes_informational_recommendations`. All 6 tests in the file pass. Total: 247 passing (was 245), 1 pre-existing failure unchanged.

**Skipped**: Android widget integration and Gemini live discoverability validation (require live env / Android build). kingdonb/mecris#162, #130, #132 remain open (require kingdonb to close).

**Next**: Gemini discoverability live validation (no code change needed), or Android widget integration for Majesty Cake counter display (kingdonb/mecris#170 Phase 4).

## 2026-04-04 — Stale issue housekeeping: closure comments on kingdonb/mecris#162, #130, #132 (session 29) 🏛️

**Planned**: Check and post/refresh closure comments on kingdonb/mecris issues #162, #130, and #132 (yebyen/mecris#88).

**Done**: Discovered #162 and #130 already had solid closure comments from session 24. Posted fresh closure comment on #132 ("FIXED: Failover sync" — 0 prior comments) via GITHUB_CLASSIC_PAT. Also discovered Android MajestyCakeWidget was already fully implemented in commit `db7ba41` — the originally-planned Majesty Cake Phase 4 coding work was already complete before this session.

**Skipped**: No code changes this session — housekeeping only. Next epic (Greek Backlog Booster #129, language sorting #121, or multiplier race #122) carries forward. Gemini live discoverability validation still requires live env.

**Next**: Start next meaningful epic — read kingdonb/mecris#129 (Greek Backlog Booster) or #121 (language dashboard sorting) and plan implementation. Majesty Cake epic kingdonb/mecris#170 is now feature-complete across all 4 phases.

## 2026-04-04 — Audit session: verified #121 and #122 already complete (session 30) 🏛️

**Planned**: Investigate and implement "visually dim languages without Beeminder goals" for kingdonb/mecris#121; then audit `surgicalUpdateInProgress` flag against kingdonb/mecris#122 race condition (yebyen/mecris#90, #91).

**Done**: Both epics were already fully implemented. #121: sort-by-safebuf (line 833), alpha-dim (line 861), NO GOAL badge (lines 881-889) — all present. #122: `surgicalUpdateInProgress` provides 5 protection layers (early-return guard, write-site guards, click-disable, synchronous flag set, 2s settle delay) that fully prevent multiplier snap-back. Posted audit comments on kingdonb/mecris#121 and #122 recommending closure. Two plan issues (yebyen/mecris#90, #91) opened and closed with findings.

**Skipped**: No code changes — pure validation session. kingdonb/mecris#129 (Greek Backlog Booster) carries forward as the next uncharted epic.

**Next**: Read the comment on kingdonb/mecris#129 to understand the Greek backlog booster scope, then design and implement. #129 issue body is null — the context is in the one existing comment.

## 2026-04-04 — Fix recommendation ordering: Greek coaching after Majesty Cake (session 31) 🏛️

**Planned**: Fix `get_narrator_context` so Greek Stack Vitality coaching follows (not precedes) the Majesty Cake daily aggregate recommendation, restoring correct priority ordering (yebyen/mecris#92).

**Done**: Moved the Greek coaching block ~15 lines down in `mcp_server.py`, after the Majesty Cake try/except block. All 21 tests now pass: 8 Greek backlog booster + 7 daily aggregate status + 6 narrator aggregate integration. Committed as `9039ac7`.

**Skipped**: No new features this session — this was a regression fix from the previous session's commit `f90bbff`.

**Next**: Consider closing kingdonb/mecris#129 (Greek Backlog Booster is implemented and tested). Investigate Ghost Archivist Phase A implementation (`user_presence` table schema) or Majesty Cake Phase 4 Android widget verification.

## 2026-04-04 — Fix two stale tests, confirm Ghost Archivist Phase A complete (session 32) 🏛️

**Planned**: Implement Ghost Archivist Phase A (`user_presence` table migration + Python DAL) — yebyen/mecris#93.

**Done**: Discovered Ghost Archivist Phase A was already fully implemented (ghost/presence.py 236 lines, ghost/archivist.py 104 lines, 001_presence_table.sql, 46 unit tests). Pivoted to repairing the 2 pre-existing test failures: (1) removed stale `default_user_id` assertion from test_neon_sync_checker_initialization — attribute dropped when credentials_manager replaced DEFAULT_USER_ID; (2) patched UsageTracker.resolve_user_id in test_language_sync_service_coordination so mock UUID matches, preventing a rogue BeeminderClient spawn in CI. Full suite: 252 passed, 0 failed.

**Skipped**: Ghost Archivist Phase B + C not started (Phases B and C need new CLI subcommand and scheduler job respectively).

**Next**: Implement Ghost Archivist Phase B — `mecris internal presence` CLI handle in `cli/main.py`. Check what presence-related commands already exist before writing new ones.

## 2026-04-05 — Encrypt message_log.error_msg; audit PII table coverage (session 33) 🏛️

**Planned**: Audit `message_log`, `walk_inferences`, `usage_sessions` for plaintext PII; apply `EncryptionService` (AES-256-GCM) to vulnerable columns; write TDG tests proving unauthenticated SQL yields only ciphertext (yebyen/mecris#94).

**Done**: Full audit completed. `usage_sessions.notes` was already encrypted (added regression guard test). `message_log.error_msg` was plaintext — added 2-line encryption guard in `mcp_server.py:send_reminder_message` and 3 passing tests in `tests/test_pii_encryption.py`. `walk_inferences` documented as out-of-scope for field-level encryption (column encryption breaks SQL filter queries; Neon at-rest encryption is the correct control). Committed as `4de2ebd`.

**Skipped**: JWKS integration (real RSA signature validation) and CLI token rotation — both carry forward as the next auth hardening priorities. These are independent of the PII encryption work.

**Next**: Implement JWKS integration in `services/auth_utils.py` — replace relaxed signature check with real public key fetch from `metnoom.urmanac.com/.well-known/jwks.json`. Then add refresh_token usage in `cli/main.py` so the CLI can renew sessions without re-opening the browser.

## 2026-04-05 — Implement JWKS RSA signature verification for JWT auth (session 34) 🏛️

**Planned**: Replace the relaxed `verify_signature: False` JWT decode in `services/auth_service.py` with real RSA public-key validation via the OIDC JWKS endpoint.

**Done**: Implemented `PyJWKClient`-backed verification in cloud mode (`MECRIS_MODE=cloud`). Standalone mode retains expiry-only check. Issuer claim now enforced. Added `tests/test_auth_service.py` with 7 tests (valid token, wrong-key 401, expiry 401, issuer mismatch 401, standalone passthrough ×2, JWKS non-invocation). All 7 pass. Committed as `3e41841`.

**Skipped**: Token rotation (`cli/main.py` refresh_token flow) — deferred, not in scope for this plan. CI full-venv verification — bot env lacks psycopg2/mcp.

**Next**: Implement `exchange_refresh_token()` so the CLI uses `refresh_token` to silently renew the session instead of re-opening the browser on token expiry.

## 2026-04-05 — Implement token refresh flow in CLI (session 35) 🏛️

**Planned**: Add `exchange_refresh_token()` to `services/auth_utils.py` and wire into `cli/main.py` so the CLI silently renews the session when the access token is expired (yebyen/mecris#96).

**Done**: `exchange_refresh_token()` added to `auth_utils.py` (refresh_token grant, no PKCE params). `try_token_refresh()` added to `cli/main.py` — checks JWT expiry, calls refresh, saves updated creds (including rotating refresh_token if returned), falls back to browser on failure. `test_exchange_refresh_token()` added to `test_auth_utils.py` — 6/6 pass. Committed as `a5bc50d`.

**Skipped**: JWKS cache TTL config (low urgency, one-liner — deferred). CI full-venv verification — bot env lacks psycopg2/mcp; known limitation.

**Next**: JWKS cache TTL (set `lifespan` on `PyJWKClient`), then open a PR from yebyen to kingdonb with the 4-commit auth hardening stack.

## 2026-04-05 — JWKS cache TTL + Submarine Mode analysis (session 36) 🏛️

**Planned**: Set `lifespan=300` on `PyJWKClient` in `services/auth_service.py`; post technical analysis on kingdonb/mecris#162 documenting how `try_token_refresh()` addresses the submarine mode failure mode (yebyen/mecris#97).

**Done**: `PyJWKClient(jwks_uri, lifespan=300)` committed as `ab1f723`. `test_auth_utils.py` 6/6 pass post-change. Submarine Mode analysis comment posted on kingdonb/mecris#162 — covers root cause (no retry, not token invalidation), implementation behavior (creds preserved on failure), and proactive refresh opportunity. Auth hardening stack confirmed merged upstream via kingdonb's `7315d67`.

**Skipped**: Proactive refresh threshold (`exp < now + 1800`) and `docs/AUTH_CONFIGURATION.md` update — both low urgency, carried to Pending.

**Next**: CI full-venv verification of `test_auth_service.py` (7 tests); `docs/AUTH_CONFIGURATION.md` submarine mode section (draft ready in #162 comment).

## 2026-04-05 — Proactive refresh threshold + AUTH_CONFIGURATION docs (session 37) 🏛️

**Planned**: Write `docs/AUTH_CONFIGURATION.md` §5 (CLI token refresh) and §6 (JWKS verification); bump `try_token_refresh()` threshold from 60s → 1800s (yebyen/mecris#98).

**Done**: `try_token_refresh()` threshold raised to `exp < now + 1800` in `cli/main.py`. `docs/AUTH_CONFIGURATION.md` §5 and §6 written — CLI submarine mode guarantee, env var table, standalone vs cloud verification modes. `test_auth_utils.py` 6/6 pass post-change. Committed as `18b7bbc`. All three NEXT_SESSION.md pending items from session 36 cleared.

**Skipped**: CI full-venv verification of `test_auth_service.py` — bot env lacks psycopg2/mcp/fastapi; known limitation, deferred to CI.

**Next**: CI verification of `test_auth_service.py` (7 tests) in full venv; optionally open upstream PR for `18b7bbc`; consider closing kingdonb/mecris#162.

## 2026-04-05 — Auth test verification + kingdonb/mecris#162 closing comment (session 38) 🏛️

**Planned**: Close kingdonb/mecris#162 with a closing summary comment, and verify `test_auth_service.py` + `test_auth_utils.py` in the bot env (yebyen/mecris#99).

**Done**: `test_auth_utils.py` 6/6 passed ✅. `test_auth_server.py` 1 passed, 1 skipped ✅. `test_auth_service.py` ImportError (no `fastapi` in bot env) — expected, documented. Closing summary comment posted on kingdonb/mecris#162 via classic PAT (all four submarine mode deliverables + CLI threshold bump documented with evidence).

**Skipped**: Actual close of kingdonb/mecris#162 — yebyen token lacks `CloseIssue` permission on kingdonb/mecris; GraphQL returned permission denied. Comment is posted; close requires kingdonb action. CI verification of `test_auth_service.py` also deferred — fastapi/psycopg2 not in bot env.

**Next**: Kingdonb to close kingdonb/mecris#162 manually (comment is ready). CI `test_auth_service.py` verification still outstanding.

## 2026-04-05 — Fix async/await mismatch in ghost archivist tests (TestRun)

**Planned**: Run post-DEFECT-003 test suite health check and audit ghost archivist coverage (yebyen/mecris#100).

**Done**: Ran bot-compatible test suite across 5 test files (39 tests). Discovered 7 failures in `tests/test_archivist.py::TestRun` — all caused by calling `async def run()` without `await`, returning a coroutine object instead of int. Fixed by adding `@pytest.mark.asyncio` + `async def` to all 7 TestRun methods and adding `await` to each `run(...)` call. All 39 tests now pass (1 expected skip for network-bound loopback test).

**Skipped**: Encryption audit (requires live Neon DB), `test_auth_service.py` CI run (requires full venv with fastapi/mcp/psycopg2), kingdonb/mecris#162 close (blocked on kingdonb permissions).

**Next**: CI verification of `test_auth_service.py` (7 tests) in GitHub Actions full venv — this is the last remaining pending item from the auth hardening stack.

## 2026-04-06 — PR review: yebyen/mecris#101 (Gemini DMZ architecture) 🏛️

**Planned**: Review yebyen/mecris#101 (tagged pr-review), run pr-test, post architectural assessment (yebyen/mecris#102).

**Done**: Reviewed all 30 files changed in the PR. Identified 3 blocking issues: (1) unresolved merge conflict markers in `sync-service/src/lib.rs` (from `origin/fix/android-ui-crash-and-polish` — code cannot compile), (2) Spin Cron re-enabled in `spin.toml` in violation of CLAUDE.md constraint, (3) NEXT_SESSION.md destructively overwritten (two active pending items lost). Posted CHANGES_REQUESTED review on yebyen/mecris#101 with full findings. Correctly skipped pr-test — compile would fail with conflict markers.

**Skipped**: `/mecris-pr-test 101` — correctly skipped. Unresolved conflict markers make compilation impossible; running tests would be waste of turns.

**Next**: Check if Gemini has resolved the 3 blockers on yebyen/mecris#101 (conflicts, Cron, NEXT_SESSION.md). If fixed, re-review and run pr-test. Also: CI verification of `test_auth_service.py` (7 tests) and kingdonb/mecris#162 manual close still outstanding.

## 2026-04-06 — Review kingdonb/mecris#173 — CHANGES_REQUESTED for same 3 DMZ blockers 🏛️

**Planned**: Review kingdonb/mecris#173 (upstream Jet-Propelled DMZ PR, no reviews yet, same head SHA as yebyen#101) and post CHANGES_REQUESTED citing the same 3 blockers (yebyen/mecris#103).

**Done**: Confirmed kingdonb/mecris#173 is same branch (`gemini-flash-rust-brain`, head `4d16c9a`) as yebyen#101. Noted Gemini's progress comment about UniFFI `mecris-core` next steps — promising direction, but not yet committed. Posted CHANGES_REQUESTED review (ID 4061831284) on kingdonb/mecris#173 via `GITHUB_CLASSIC_PAT` citing all 3 blockers with cross-reference to yebyen#101. Both upstream and fork PRs now have CHANGES_REQUESTED.

**Skipped**: Nothing — full plan executed.

**Next**: Check if Gemini resolves the 3 blockers on `gemini-flash-rust-brain` (merge conflicts in sync-service/src/lib.rs, Spin Cron disabled, NEXT_SESSION.md pending items restored). Once fixed, re-review both PRs and run `/mecris-pr-test 101`.

## 2026-04-06 — Stall confirmation: Gemini DMZ still blocked, status comments posted on both PRs 🏛️

**Planned**: Orient, check if Gemini pushed DMZ fixes, post status update.

**Done**: Confirmed `gemini-flash-rust-brain` head still `4d16c9a9` — no new commits from Gemini across 3 bot sessions. Posted stall status comments on yebyen/mecris#101 (comment #4192723975) and kingdonb/mecris#173 (comment #4192724840) noting all 3 blockers remain unresolved. Confirmed upstream sync (yebyen/mecris main == kingdonb/mecris main == `ae8e1ba`). Assessed independent work options — Twilio epics (#166-#169) require DMZ merge first; no independent actionable work found.

**Skipped**: No coding work — session was status-check-only. No plan issue created (no new development work to plan).

**Next**: Check if Gemini has resolved the 3 DMZ blockers (merge conflicts in `sync-service/src/lib.rs`, Spin Cron still disabled in `spin.toml`, NEXT_SESSION.md pending items preserved). Once fixed, re-review and run `/mecris-pr-test 101`.

## 2026-04-06 — Resolved 3 DMZ PR blockers; pr-test green on gemini-flash-rust-brain

**Planned**: Fix 3 CHANGES_REQUESTED blockers on `gemini-flash-rust-brain` after 4-session Gemini stall: merge conflicts in `src/lib.rs`, cron re-enabled in `spin.toml`, NEXT_SESSION.md not preserving pending items. Then run pr-test on yebyen/mecris#101. (Plan: yebyen/mecris#105)

**Done**: All 3 blockers resolved by mecris-bot directly on the branch. (1) Both merge conflict regions in `mecris-go-spin/sync-service/src/lib.rs` resolved by taking HEAD versions — removes 59 lines of conflict markers and android-fix duplicate definitions. (2) `[[trigger.cron]]` block removed from `mecris-go-spin/sync-service/spin.toml`. (3) NEXT_SESSION.md on the branch aligned with main's content to allow clean git merge in pr-test. pr-test dispatched and passed (run 24039612500, head `7501805`). PR comment posted on yebyen/mecris#101 noting blockers cleared and pr-test green.

**Skipped**: Did not re-review kingdonb/mecris#173 with a new approval — the fixes are on the same branch but the upstream PR review state still shows CHANGES_REQUESTED. Deferred to next session.

**Next**: Merge yebyen/mecris#101 (needs kingdonb approval) and follow up on kingdonb/mecris#173 with a review update noting blockers resolved.

## 2026-04-06 — Status comment on kingdonb/mecris#173: forks diverged, fixes in yebyen only

**Planned**: Post follow-up review on kingdonb/mecris#173 confirming all 3 CHANGES_REQUESTED blockers resolved. (Plan: yebyen/mecris#106)

**Done**: Investigated and found that kingdonb/mecris#173 head is still `4d16c9a9` — the 3 blockers are present in kingdonb's branch. Fixes were applied only to yebyen:gemini-flash-rust-brain (head `7501805`). Posted an accurate status comment on kingdonb/mecris#173 (#issuecomment-4194069091) explaining the fork divergence and the path to resolution: kingdonb needs to pull yebyen's fixes into kingdonb:gemini-flash-rust-brain before the CHANGES_REQUESTED can be lifted.

**Skipped**: Did not post an "approval" review — that would have been inaccurate. The CHANGES_REQUESTED review against `4d16c9a9` is still correct.

**Next**: Wait for kingdonb to integrate yebyen/mecris#101 fixes into kingdonb:gemini-flash-rust-brain, then re-review #173 or confirm merge of #101.
