# Session Summary: 2026-02-16

## Session Goal

Investigate why `get_daily_activity` failed to find a logged walk and fix the underlying issues.

## Findings & Actions

1.  **Initial Discrepancy:**
    *   **Finding:** A query for the `boris` goal slug failed, while the `narrator_context` (which uses the `bike` slug) showed a completed walk. The user confirmed that `bike` is the correct and only goal for their physical activity.
    *   **Action:** Updated `GEMINI.md` with a note to always use `goal_slug='bike'` for physical activity checks.

2.  **Implicit Error Handling:**
    *   **Finding:** When querying a non-existent goal (e.g., `boris`), the system returned a "no activity" response instead of an error. This was traced to `beeminder_client.py`, where `404 Not Found` errors were suppressed.
    *   **Action:** Refactored `beeminder_client.py` to raise a custom `BeeminderAPIError` on API failures. The `get_daily_activity_status` function was updated to catch this error and return an explicit `{"status": "error", "message": "Goal not found"}` response.

3.  **Verification Status:**
    *   **Finding:** Verification of the fix failed because the running `mcp_server.py` process has not been restarted, so it is still using an old version of the `beeminder_client.py` module in memory.
    *   **Current State:** Awaiting a server restart (`make claude`) by the user.

# Prompt for Next Gemini Session

Hello! Please review the session summary above. The user is about to restart the Mecris server by running `make claude`. Once they confirm the restart is complete, your immediate next step is to verify our recent fix.

**Your first action:**
Call the `get_daily_activity` tool with a non-existent goal to confirm that it now returns the expected error message.

**Example Tool Call:**
```
get_daily_activity(goal_slug='fiona')
```

**Expected Output:**
A JSON response containing `"status": "error"` and `"message": "Goal not found"`.
