# Mecris Budget and Goal Analysis

*Analysis Date: March 21, 2026*

## Executive Summary

I analyzed the Mecris narrator context system after the migration to **Neon PostgreSQL** and the implementation of **Multi-Tenancy**. The system now has a robust, user-isolated goal tracking mechanism and smart alert spam protection.

## Multi-Tenant Data Analysis

### Real vs Mocked Data

**REAL (Calculated & Isolated):**
- `total_budget` and `remaining_budget`: Stored in `budget_tracking`, scoped by `user_id`. ✅ 
- `used_budget`: Calculated per user. ✅ 
- `days_remaining`: Calculated from `budget_period_end` per user. ✅
- Database records of actual token usage sessions in `usage_sessions` table with `user_id` constraint. ✅

**PREVIOUSLY MOCKED (Now Fixed):**
- `today_spend`: Actually calculated from database ✅
- `daily_burn_rate`: Weekly average / 7 from real sessions ✅  
- `projected_spend`: `daily_burn_rate * days_remaining` ✅
- Budget health and alerts: Rule-based from real thresholds ✅

**Key Finding**: The budget calculations were actually legitimate! The issue was with the goals system returning "no active goals found."

## Goals System Innovation

### Problem Solved
The "no active goals found - consider setting objectives" message was triggered because the Obsidian integration wasn't working, but the system fell back gracefully.

### Solution: Hybrid Architecture
- **Neon goals**: Goals are stored in the Neon PostgreSQL `goals` table, scoped by `user_id`.
- **Obsidian fallback**: System gracefully handles Obsidian being unavailable
- **Script-based completion**: `complete_goal.sh` works like `update_budget.sh`

### Mock Goals Implemented
1. **Finish KubeCon abstract draft** (high priority, due 2025-08-03)
2. **Test Twilio integration** (high priority)  
3. **Complete Obsidian MCP integration** (medium priority, due 2025-08-04)
4. **Optimize budget burn rate** (high priority, due 2025-08-05)
5. **Document Mecris control loop** (medium priority)
6. **Set up goal completion workflow** (low priority) ✅ COMPLETED

## Alert Spam Protection Design

### Problem
Without cooldown protection, the system could spam alerts when budget is critically low or when beemergencies persist.

### Solution: Time-Based Cooldowns (User-Aware)
- **Critical budget alerts**: 2-hour cooldown.
- **Warning budget alerts**: 6-hour cooldown.  
- **Beemergency alerts**: 90-minute cooldown (shorter due to time sensitivity).
- **Alert logging**: Full audit trail in `alert_log` table, scoped by `user_id`.
- **Graceful degradation**: Returns alert status with cooldown reason.

### Innovation: Context-Aware Cooldowns
Different alert types have different urgency profiles:
- Budget warnings can wait longer (you can't fix budget immediately)
- Beemergencies need shorter intervals (goals derail in hours)
- System tracks alert history to prevent notification fatigue

## Budget Expiry Strategy

### Current Status
- **Budget**: $11.82 remaining of $24.02 total
- **Timeline**: 1.0 days until August 5, 2025
- **Burn rate**: $0.0152/day (very conservative estimate)
- **Projected outcome**: Should have ~$11.80 left on August 5

### August 5 Test Plan
1. **Early morning check**: Verify system still responding
2. **Budget alerts**: Test if alerts still fire when $0 remaining
3. **Control loop**: Verify Mecris continues operating post-expiry
4. **Final documentation**: Log exact behavior when credits expire

### Smart Spend Strategy
- Target: End with $0-3 remaining (no waste, no early cutoff)
- Current trajectory: Very conservative, likely to have surplus
- Recommendation: Can increase usage slightly for testing/documentation

## Technical Innovations

### 1. Multi-Tenant Database Schema
Migrated from SQLite to Neon PostgreSQL with strict row-level isolation via `user_id` on all tables.

### 2. Distributed Leader Election
Added a `scheduler_election` table to coordinate background tasks across multiple server instances per user.

### 3. WhatsApp Template Integration
Implemented Twilio Content API integration with approved templates (`mecris_status_v2`) for reliable proactive messaging.

### 4. Goal Completion Workflow
Script-based interface matching existing `update_budget.sh` pattern:
```bash
./complete_goal.sh 6  # Mark goal #6 complete
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Today)
1. **Test Twilio integration** - Complete high-priority goal #2
2. **Continue KubeCon abstract** - Goal #1 due today
3. **Monitor budget burn rate** - We're under-spending

### Pre-August 5
1. **Test full control loop** - Verify all systems integrated
2. **Document edge cases** - What happens at $0 budget?
3. **Set up monitoring** - Ensure alerts work when budget expires

### Post-August 5
1. **New budget cycle setup** - Update period_end date
2. **Goal completion review** - Which mock goals became real work?
3. **System optimization** - Based on real usage patterns

## System Health

### Current Status: **OPERATIONAL** ✅
- ✅ Budget tracking: Multi-tenant real-time calculations.
- ✅ Goal management: User-scoped active goals.
- ✅ Alert system: WhatsApp Template delivery with user-isolated cooldowns.
- ✅ Beeminder integration: Monitored via user-provided tokens.
- ✅ Background Sync: Distributed leader-based sync for walks and reviews.

### Risk Assessment: **LOW**
- No critical beemergencies.
- Multi-tenancy hardened via database constraints.
- All systems have graceful fallbacks to console or SMS.
