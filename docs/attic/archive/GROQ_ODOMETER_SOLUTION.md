# Groq Odometer Solution - Complete Implementation

## Executive Summary

We've solved the **Groq odometer problem** with a comprehensive tracking system that:
1. **Tracks cumulative monthly usage** like a car odometer
2. **Detects month-end resets** automatically
3. **Generates conversational reminders** through the narrator
4. **Integrates with virtual budget** for unified cost management

## The Odometer Problem (As Defined by Beeminder)

Groq's billing presents a classic "odometer goal" challenge:
- **Monotonically increasing** within each month (only goes up)
- **Resets to zero** at month boundaries
- **15-minute delay** in reporting
- **No API access** - requires manual input

This is exactly like tracking miles on a car that mysteriously resets its odometer every month!

## Our Solution Architecture

### 1. Odometer Tracking System (`groq_odometer_tracker.py`)

```python
class GroqOdometerTracker:
    """
    Intelligent odometer tracking with:
    - Reset detection at month boundaries
    - Daily usage derivation from cumulative values
    - Reminder generation based on calendar
    - Virtual budget integration
    """
```

**Key Features:**
- **Smart Reset Detection**: Compares values across month boundaries
- **Daily Usage Calculation**: Derives daily costs from cumulative monthly
- **Stale Data Detection**: Alerts when readings are >7 days old
- **Month-End Finalization**: Captures final values before reset

### 2. Conversational Reminder System

The narrator now **proactively reminds** Kingdon about Groq readings:

```python
# Reminder triggers:
- Days 28-31: "📊 Hey, we're 2 days from month-end. Mind checking your Groq usage?"
- Days 1-3: "New month! Did you capture last month's final Groq total?"
- Every 7 days: "I notice we haven't updated Groq data in a week. Current reading?"
```

### 3. MCP Integration (3 New Endpoints)

#### `POST /groq/odometer/record`
Records manual readings and calculates daily estimates:
```json
{
  "value": 1.06,
  "notes": "End of month reading from console"
}
```

#### `GET /groq/odometer/status`  
Returns current status and reminders:
```json
{
  "status": "approaching_reset",
  "days_until_reset": 2,
  "reminders": [
    {
      "type": "month_end",
      "urgency": "high",
      "message": "📊 Groq usage reading needed in 2 days"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### `GET /groq/odometer/context`
Provides narrator integration data:
```json
{
  "groq_tracking": {
    "status": "approaching_reset",
    "urgent_reminder": "📊 Groq usage reading needed in 2 days",
    "current_month_spend": 1.06,
    "daily_average": 0.0353
  }
}
```

### 4. Virtual Budget Integration

Odometer readings automatically flow into the virtual budget system:

```python
# When recording odometer reading:
1. Calculate daily usage from cumulative
2. Estimate token count from cost
3. Record in virtual budget as Provider.GROQ
4. Track alongside Anthropic usage
```

## How It Works - User Journey

### Day 1: Initial Setup
**User**: "Groq shows $0.15 today"
**Narrator**: "Thanks! I've recorded $0.15 for September. Daily estimate: $0.15. I'll remind you before month-end."

### Day 15: Mid-Month Check
**Narrator**: "Hey, we haven't updated Groq in a week. What's the current reading?"
**User**: "It's at $0.68 now"
**Narrator**: "Got it! $0.68 total, averaging $0.045/day. Looking good!"

### Day 28: Month-End Reminder
**Narrator**: "📊 We're 3 days from month-end. Please check your Groq usage so we capture the final total."
**User**: "Shows $1.06"
**Narrator**: "Perfect! $1.06 for the month. I'll remind you to check again on the 1st for the reset."

### Day 1 (New Month): Reset Detection
**User**: "Groq is at $0.02 now"
**Narrator**: "New month detected! Last month finalized at $1.06. Starting October with $0.02."

## Database Schema

```sql
-- Odometer readings with reset tracking
CREATE TABLE groq_odometer_readings (
    timestamp TEXT,
    month TEXT,            -- YYYY-MM format
    cumulative_value REAL,
    is_final_reading BOOLEAN,
    is_reset BOOLEAN      -- Marks month boundaries
);

-- Monthly summaries for historical tracking
CREATE TABLE groq_monthly_summaries (
    month TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    total_cost REAL,
    finalized BOOLEAN
);

-- Reminder scheduling
CREATE TABLE groq_reminders (
    reminder_type TEXT,    -- 'month_end', 'stale_data'
    scheduled_for DATE,
    sent BOOLEAN
);
```

## Reminder Logic

### Proactive Reminders
```python
def check_reminder_needs():
    # 1. Month-end approaching (last 3 days)
    if days_until_month_end <= 3:
        urgency = "high" if days <= 1 else "medium"
        
    # 2. Stale data (>7 days old)
    if days_since_reading > 7:
        urgency = "low"
        
    # 3. Missed month-end (first 3 days of new month)
    if day_of_month <= 3 and not last_month_finalized:
        urgency = "high"
```

### Conversational Integration (CLAUDE.md)
The narrator now knows to:
- Check Groq reminder status in every context call
- Surface urgent reminders in recommendations
- Use natural language for prompts
- Thank users for readings and calculate estimates

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Manual Entry (Not OAuth/Scraping)
**Why**: OAuth too complex for MVP, scraping violates ToS
**Solution**: Conversational reminders make manual entry frictionless

### 2. Daily Estimates from Monthly Cumulative
**Why**: Groq only shows monthly totals
**Solution**: Divide by day-of-month for average, track day-to-day differences when available

### 3. Conversational Reminders (Not Cron)
**Why**: More human, fits existing narrator pattern
**Solution**: Narrator checks reminder status on every interaction

### 4. Reset Detection Logic
**Why**: Need to handle month boundaries cleanly
**Solution**: Compare values across months, finalize when reset detected

## Production Deployment

### Immediate Steps
1. **First Reading**: User provides current Groq value
2. **Daily Flow**: Narrator reminds based on staleness
3. **Month-End**: Urgent reminders to capture final value
4. **Reconciliation**: Monthly summaries feed into billing reports

### Configuration Required
```bash
# No environment variables needed!
# Everything works through conversational interface
```

### Testing the System
```bash
# Record a reading
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/groq/odometer/record \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value": 1.06, "notes": "From console"}'

# Check status
curl http://localhost:8000/groq/odometer/status

# Get narrator context
curl http://localhost:8000/groq/odometer/context
```

## Success Metrics

✅ **Odometer tracking working** - Records cumulative values
✅ **Reset detection implemented** - Handles month boundaries
✅ **Reminder system active** - Proactive conversational prompts
✅ **Virtual budget integrated** - Unified with Anthropic tracking
✅ **MCP endpoints live** - 3 new endpoints functional
✅ **Narrator enhanced** - CLAUDE.md updated with instructions

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1 (Now): Manual Entry
- User provides readings via conversation
- Narrator reminds about important dates
- Daily estimates from monthly totals

### Phase 2 (When Groq Adds API): Automatic Polling
- Replace manual entry with API calls
- Keep odometer logic for reset handling
- Maintain conversational confirmations

### Phase 3 (Advanced): Predictive Reminders
- Learn user's Groq usage patterns
- Predict month-end totals
- Alert if usage exceeds typical patterns

## The Conversational Magic ✨

Instead of complex OAuth or sketchy scraping, we've turned a technical problem into a **human conversation**:

**Not this**: "ERROR: Failed to authenticate OAuth"
**But this**: "Hey, we're 2 days from month-end. What's your Groq reading?"

**Not this**: "WARNING: Scraper blocked by rate limit"
**But this**: "I notice we haven't updated Groq in a week. Current value?"

**Not this**: "CRON: 0 0 1 * * /usr/bin/reconcile"
**But this**: "New month! Did you capture last month's final total?"

This solution respects:
- **Groq's ToS** (no scraping)
- **User's time** (gentle reminders, not alarms)
- **System simplicity** (no OAuth complexity)
- **Data accuracy** (captures month-end values)
