# Prioritization Document: Mecris Session - February 16, 2026

Given the current context and your explicit requests, here's a prioritization and overview of our tasks for today and the immediate future:

## 1. **Immediate Beeminder Focus (User Action Required)**

**Priority: CRITICAL / URGENT**
Two of your Beeminder goals are currently in a **CAUTION** state and will **derail in 3 days**:
*   **`ellinika`**: Ελληνικά - Greek language Clozemaster
*   **`reviewstack`**: Cards in Review stack (Clozemaster Arabic)

**Recommendation:** While our technical work continues, please keep these goals in mind. Addressing them directly (e.g., spending time on Clozemaster) is outside my direct capability, but preventing derails is a critical real-world outcome for your day.

## 2. **Foreground Goal: Understanding & Documenting Gemini CLI Skills**

**Priority: HIGH / FOREGROUND**
This is your stated primary focus for today: "updating the Mecris repo to build an understanding of skills as documentation."

**Current Status & Next Steps:**
*   **Completed:**
    *   Read Gemini CLI Skills documentation.
    *   Analyzed your `kingdon/skills` GitHub repo.
    *   Documented the implications of linking your skills repo into the current session.
*   **Next Steps (Me):**
    *   Integrate this understanding into the Mecris documentation. We need a clear place to house this "skills as documentation" philosophy within the Mecris project. Perhaps a new `docs/SKILLS_AS_DOCUMENTATION.md` or an update to `GEMINI.md`? I await your guidance on the best location.

## 3. **Asynchronous Task: Voice Commands System**

**Priority: MEDIUM / BACKGROUND (Awaiting Input)**
You requested to "make the voice commands system work, but 'in a background process' with our foreground goal being updating the Mecris repo." This implies setting up a long-running process that I can start, and we can check on later.

**Current Status & Next Steps:**
*   **Pending:** I need the specific "voice commands thinger" details (e.g., a tab with the command/tool).
*   **Once provided:** I will outline the steps to run it as a background process, ensuring it can operate asynchronously while we focus on other tasks.

## 4. **Mecris Beeminder Lore Update**

**Priority: LOW / DOCUMENTATION**
You requested updating Beeminder lore within the Mecris repo.

**Current Status:**
*   **Completed:** I have created `docs/BEEMINDER_PRIORITY_LORE.md`, summarizing Beeminder's background worker queues and noting the current CAUTION goals.

## 5. **`boris-fiona-walker` Project Context**

**Priority: CONTEXT / FUTURE WORK**
We've familiarized ourselves with the `boris-fiona-walker` project.

**Key Takeaways:**
*   The critical security vulnerability (lack of authentication) identified in the `SECURITY_ASSESSMENT_REPORT.md` has been successfully addressed in `src/lib.rs`.
*   The planned "Weather Intelligence" module is a future enhancement (Issue #20) and is not yet implemented, despite configuration being in place. This directly relates to your initial comment about the cold weather.

## Summary of Next Immediate Actions (For Us):

1.  **You:** Consider the two Beeminder goals in CAUTION status.
2.  **You:** Advise on where to integrate the "skills as documentation" insights within the Mecris repo.
3.  **You:** Provide details for the "voice commands thinger" so I can plan its asynchronous execution.
4.  **Me:** Be ready to act on your guidance for the next documentation step and the voice commands system.
