# Handling Unexpected High-Cost Tasks

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Task Cost Estimation Model
- Implement a pre-execution cost estimation mechanism
- Use historical data to predict token consumption
- Develop a simple classification:
  - Low-cost tasks (< $0.10)
  - Medium-cost tasks ($0.10 - $1.00)
  - High-cost tasks (> $1.00)

### 2. Task Prioritization Framework
- Implement a cost-aware prioritization system
- Prioritize tasks based on:
  - Estimated cost
  - Strategic importance
  - Potential for deferral

### 3. Adaptive Budgeting Techniques
- Soft budget caps for individual tasks
- Automatic task suspension if cost exceeds threshold
- Fallback mechanisms:
  - Switch to more cost-effective model
  - Break complex tasks into smaller, cheaper subtasks
  - Defer non-critical work

### 4. Emergency Cost Control
- Implement a "circuit breaker" mechanism
- Automatic system-wide pause when:
  - Burn rate exceeds $2/hour
  - Projected total cost would exceed remaining budget
- Provide manual override with explicit confirmation

### 5. Logging and Transparency
- Detailed cost logging for each task
- Real-time cost tracking dashboard
- Immediate notifications for high-cost events

## Practical Approach for $25 Budget
- Optimal burn rate: ~$1/hour
- Total available time: Approximately 25 hours
- Recommended strategy: 
  1. Start with critical, well-scoped tasks
  2. Continuously monitor token consumption
  3. Be prepared to pivot or pause work
  4. Accept that the budget may be exhausted before all desired work is complete
