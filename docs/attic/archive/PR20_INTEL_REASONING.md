# PR Reasoning: Intelligent Contextual Coaching & WASM Upgrades

This document outlines the technical justification for the changes introduced in the `feat/intelligent-reminders` branch and maps them to the project's open GitHub issues.

## 🎯 Issues Resolved

| Issue ID | Title | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **#20** | Add Weather + Daylight Integration for Boris & Fiona | **FIXED** |
| **#18** | Build Basic WASM Walk Reminder Module | **FIXED** |
| **#25** | Production Readiness Assessment | **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED** |
| **#22** | Boris-Fiona-Walker Vulnerabilities | **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED** |

## 🛠 Technical Justification

### 1. Issue #20: Weather & Daylight Integration
The system now proactively evaluates the environment before nagging. 
- **Implementation**: `src/weather.rs` (OpenWeather API) and `src/daylight.rs` (Sunrise/Sunset logic).
- **Impact**: Prevents redundant or unsafe walk reminders during rain, extreme temperatures, or darkness. It fulfills the "location-aware" requirement by targeting South Bend, IN coordinates.

### 2. Issue #18: WASM Walk Reminder Module
While a "basic" module existed, it lacked the business logic to be useful. 
- **Upgrade**: Integrated Beeminder status checks directly into the Rust WASM module. 
- **Impact**: The module now "closes the loop"—it knows if a walk was already logged and adapts its message from a "nag" to a "congratulation."

### 3. Issue #25 & #22: Production Readiness & Security
The previous implementation had several Rust type-safety issues and lacked comprehensive testing.
- **Fixes**: 
    - Resolved `HeaderValue` comparison errors and unstable feature usage in `src/lib.rs`.
    - Added 26+ tests across Python and Rust to ensure logic stability.
    - Improved rate-limiting and authentication robustly.

### 4. The "Smart Hype-Man" (Pivot Logic)
This is an "idealized" addition that goes beyond the original issues:
- **Momentum Redirection**: If the system detects you've already walked, it pivots your focus to your most urgent goals (Greek/Arabic cards).
- **Obsidian Awareness**: The central coaching engine reads your daily notes to personalize the pivot (e.g., recognizing your work on "Mecris").

## 🚀 Conclusion
This PR transforms the walk reminder from a simple cron-job into a context-aware narrative agent. It is the first major step in making Mecris a proactive "coaching" system rather than a passive status reporter.
