# Skills as Documentation in Mecris

This document outlines the philosophy and practical implications of treating Agent Skills as a primary form of documentation within the Mecris system, particularly in the context of the Gemini CLI and integration with custom skill repositories.

## 1. The Philosophy: Skills as Executable Documentation

Agent Skills, as supported by the Gemini CLI, move beyond traditional prose-based documentation to provide **executable specifications** of knowledge and workflows. Instead of merely describing *how* to perform a task, a skill *encapsulates* that knowledge and enables an agent to *perform* the task.

**Key tenets of this philosophy:**

*   **Actionable Knowledge:** Documentation is not passive; it directly informs and enables agent actions.
*   **Reduced Ambiguity:** Code and structured data (within a skill) are less ambiguous than natural language.
*   **Consistency & Repeatability:** Workflows defined in skills ensure tasks are executed consistently every time.
*   **Progressive Disclosure:** Agents (and human users) interact with the most relevant documentation when needed, without being overwhelmed.

## 2. Gemini CLI Agent Skills Overview

The Gemini CLI allows extending agent capabilities through self-contained `Agent Skills` directories. These skills bundle instructions, resources, and specific procedural guidance, acting as specialized expertise.

**Key Features (from Gemini CLI documentation):**
*   **Shared Expertise:** Packages complex workflows for reuse.
*   **Repeatable Workflows:** Ensures consistent task execution.
*   **Resource Bundling:** Includes scripts, templates, or example data.
*   **Progressive Disclosure:** Only skill metadata loads initially, saving context tokens.
*   **Management:** Skills can be listed, linked, disabled, enabled, and reloaded via `/skills` command or `gemini skills` CLI.
*   **Autonomous Employment:** Gemini autonomously decides to use a skill based on request and description; activation requires user approval.
*   **Resource Access:** Activated skills grant the agent access to their bundled files and specific tools.

## 3. Implications of Linking `kingdon/skills` into Mecris

Integrating your personal `kingdon/skills` repository (`https://github.com/kingdon/skills`) significantly enhances Mecris's capabilities by providing a rich library of pre-defined, executable knowledge.

**Specific implications include:**

### a. **Expanded Capabilities & Specialized Expertise**
*   **Domain-Specific Knowledge:** Skills related to DevOps, Flux, Crossplane, Prometheus, and AlertManager (e.g., `flux-operator`, `prometheus-observer`) would become available. This allows the agent to address highly technical tasks in these domains.
*   **Pre-defined Workflows:** Instead of devising solutions from scratch, the agent can leverage structured, proven workflows for tasks like monitoring Flux environments or installing AlertManager.

### b. **Context-Sensitive Knowledge Activation**
*   **Token Efficiency:** Initially, only metadata for skills would be loaded. This conserves the active context window.
*   **On-Demand Deep Dive:** When a user request triggers a relevant skill (and with user approval), its full instructions and resources are brought into the conversation. This ensures that detailed, task-specific documentation is present exactly when required by the agent.

### c. **Structured Resource Access & Tooling**
*   **Bundled Assets:** Skills often contain scripts, configuration templates, or reference data. Linking the repository grants the agent permission to read these assets directly, making them part of the task execution.
*   **Controlled Tooling:** Skills are designed with defined permissions, meaning the agent would operate within specified boundaries when utilizing tools or executing commands associated with a particular skill.

### d. **Enhanced Workflow Reliability & Verification**
*   **Executable Guidance:** The core procedural guidance within each skill acts as an executable checklist or script, guiding the agent step-by-step.
*   **Validation & Success Criteria:** Many skills embed "validation patterns" and "quality checks," allowing the agent to systematically verify the successful completion and correctness of its actions.

### e. **Accelerated Development & Collaboration**
*   **Rapid Task Execution:** For recurring or well-defined tasks, skills enable rapid and consistent execution.
*   **Shared Understanding:** The very act of defining a skill enforces a structured approach to problem-solving, making it easier for humans and agents to collaborate on complex operational tasks.
*   **`tdg` as Reference:** The inclusion of the `tdg` (Test-Driven Generation) submodule in `kingdon/skills` underscores a commitment to robust, well-formatted, and verifiable skill definitions, which are essential for treating skills *as* documentation.

## 4. Integrating Skills into Mecris Operations

For Mecris, treating skills as documentation means:

*   **Proactive Skill Development:** Identifying recurring tasks or complex knowledge domains and encapsulating them into new Agent Skills.
*   **Referencing Skills:** Explicitly noting which skills are applicable to certain types of problems or goals within other Mecris documentation (e.g., `GEMINI.md`, `README.md`).
*   **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly refining existing skills, much like updating documentation, to reflect new best practices or system changes.

By embracing skills as a form of executable, context-aware documentation, Mecris can significantly enhance its autonomy, efficiency, and the reliability of its operational directives.
