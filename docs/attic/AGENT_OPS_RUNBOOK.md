# Agent Operations Runbook & Workarounds

This document records the operational quirks, workarounds, and nuances required for an AI agent to successfully interact with the Mecris environment, particularly during status updates, deployments, and debugging.

## 1. Authentication & Network Hangs (The VPN Issue)

**The Problem:**
If the user is disconnected from their VPN, OIDC token refreshes to `metnoom.urmanac.com` will fail because the host is unreachable. Previously, the `mecris login` CLI would hang indefinitely in a synchronous `requests.post` call, ignoring `Ctrl+C` because background threads blocked the Python interpreter from shutting down.

**The Fix / Workaround:**
1.  **Timeouts:** All `requests.post` calls in `services/auth_utils.py` must have explicit timeouts (`timeout=(3.0, 10.0)`).
2.  **Graceful Exits:** `cli/main.py` uses explicit `signal` handlers trapping `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` to call `os._exit(130)` (a hard system exit), bypassing Python's thread-joining behavior.

**Operational Rule for Agents:**
When fetching status updates via CLI or MCP (`get_narrator_context`), if you encounter a timeout or hang, **do not attempt to fix the network**. Assume the user is off-VPN and wait for them to reconnect or use standalone fallbacks.

## 2. Health Connect Step & Distance Discrepancies

**The Problem:**
The Mecris Go Android app often reports different step counts and distances than native apps like Google Fit (e.g., Fit reports 1183 steps / 0.51 miles, while Mecris Go reports 2303 steps / 0.44 miles).

**The Explanation:**
Mecris Go uses Android's `HealthConnectClient.aggregate()` API. 
*   **Steps (`StepsRecord.COUNT_TOTAL`):** Health Connect automatically merges and deduplicates step data from *all* sources on the device (hardware pedometer, Google Fit, other wearables). If the hardware pedometer counted steps while the phone was in a pocket, but Fit wasn't tracking an explicit workout, the aggregate steps will be *higher* than Fit's isolated report.
*   **Distance (`DistanceRecord.DISTANCE_TOTAL`):** Distance is heavily reliant on GPS and stride-length estimates. Different apps use different algorithms. Health Connect's deduplication might prioritize a hardware sensor's shorter distance estimate over Google Fit's GPS-interpolated distance. 

**Operational Rule for Agents:**
When users ask about step/distance discrepancies, explain that Mecris relies on the **Health Connect Deduplicated Aggregate**, which is the "ground truth" intersection of all device sensors, not just one app's opinion. The discrepancy is a feature of the Android OS, not a bug in Mecris.

## 3. Autonomous Reminder Triggers (Spin Cloud)

**The Problem:**
Fermyon Spin Cloud does not support cron triggers. The newly built Rust WASM reminders (`/internal/trigger-reminders`) were initially orphaned.

**The Workaround:**
The Android app pushes step data to `/internal/cloud-sync`. The Rust backend has been modified so that *every successful cloud-sync automatically chains into a trigger-reminders evaluation*. 

**Operational Rule for Agents:**
To manually force an autonomous reminder check in the cloud, you must simulate an Android sync by sending an authenticated POST to the `/internal/cloud-sync` endpoint on the Spin Cloud URL.

## 4. Spin Cloud Variable Provisioning

**The Problem:**
Global settings (like Twilio keys and OpenWeather coordinates) must be manually provisioned in Spin Cloud because they are excluded from source control.

**The Workaround:**
Agents must use the explicit `spin cloud variables set` command (not `variable set`).
Example:
```bash
spin cloud variables set --app mecris-sync-v2 twilio_account_sid="AC123..."
```
*Note: Twilio auth tokens must be encrypted using `AES-256-GCM` with the `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY` before being stored in Spin variables.*

## 5. MCP Server Operations & Auth Workarounds

**The Problem:**
In `MECRIS_MODE=multi-tenant`, the MCP server strictly requires a `user_id` for almost every tool call. If an agent calls a tool (like `get_narrator_context`) without an explicit ID, the server returns "Authentication Required," even if the user has successfully run `mecris login` on the local machine.

**The Workaround:**
Agents must explicitly provide the `user_id` in tool calls. 
1.  Locate the local user ID: `cat ~/.mecris/credentials.json | jq -r .user_id`.
2.  Pass it to the tool: `mcp_mecris_get_narrator_context(user_id="...")`.

**Process Restarts:**
If the server hangs or needs to pick up changes to local files (like `data/sms_consent.json`), it can be manually restarted by killing the process. **The Gemini CLI acts as the supervisor** and will automatically attempt to re-spawn the STDIO server upon the next tool call.
1.  Find the PID: `ps aux | grep mcp_server.py`
2.  Terminate it: `kill <PID>`
3.  The Gemini CLI will restart the server on the next turn, though there may be a brief "Not connected" error during the transition.

## 6. Multi-Tenancy Technical Debt (Updated)

**The Problem:**
The system is currently hardcoded to South Bend coordinates for weather, and SMS preferences are stored in a local `data/sms_consent.json` file. Additionally, the local `CredentialsManager` ignores stored credentials when the mode is set to `multi-tenant`, breaking the "default user" experience for local operators.

**Operational Rule for Agents:**
Until true database-backed multi-tenancy is built for these features, agents must manually manipulate `data/sms_consent.json` to toggle `vacation_mode` or adjust time windows. Weather coordinates must be manually updated via Spin Cloud variables if the user travels. If auth fails, use the `user_id` workaround in section 5.

## 7. Data Access Model & Master Mode Realities

**Master Access:**
The MCP server operates in "Master Mode." This means it has direct, root-level access to the Postgres/Neon database. Any "authentication" performed by the MCP server is permissive—it simply reads a UUID from a local config file and uses it to query the DB. There is no cryptographic security enforced at the tool layer for local operators.

**Infrastructure Isolation (Neon):**
Neon "Compute Units" (CU) are a billable metric. 
- **Policy:** We never share database access with external tenants or forked instances.
- **Rule for Agents:** If a user asks how to set up their own instance, instruct them to provision their own Neon or Postgres database. Sharing our Neon instance is akin to allowing others to sign checks in our name.

**PII Requirements:**
Access to any PII (encrypted phone numbers or service tokens) strictly requires the `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Without this key, the data is unusable by either the MCP server or the Spin API.

## 8. GDPR-Style Compliance Flags (Informational)

The following gaps exist in the current implementation and would likely be flagged in a formal compliance review:
- **No Self-Service Deletion:** Right to erasure is currently manual-SQL only.
- **No Machine-Readable Export:** Data portability is unimplemented.
- **Permissive Local Auth:** Local access assumes total trust of the host environment.

See **`docs/DATA_ARCHITECTURE_AND_PRIVACY.md`** for the full assessment.
